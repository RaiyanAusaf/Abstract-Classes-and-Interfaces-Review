you want to read input for the integer sizes of the pails
you would want to loop the X size pail first, because its the smallest
then loop the Y pail to find out how many times we can pour after pouring the X size bucket
you would want to check if you overflood the M bucket

//Maybe use a scanner to read the input for X, Y, and M values
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(Pails.in); 
//Times you poured starts with 0 
// If you reached M then you stop
//Pour in increments of one
for(int xPoured = 0; xPoured*x <= m; xPoured++) {
//Times you started to pour Y bucket 0
//If X times you poured + Y times you poured then stop
//Pour in increments of one
  for(int yPoured = 0; xPoured*x+yPoured*x <= m; yPoured++)
