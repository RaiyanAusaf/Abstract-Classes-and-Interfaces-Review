The first assignment in which we swap pairs of intergers I faced the problem for me was converting an int to an int[] and backwards.
I spent a lot of time on that first assignment 

The second assignment I did not know what recursion was but I found out that its a technique you can use in Java to call a method 
to solve a problem. I still kind of dont get it. The first assignment kind of helped me a little to attempt to tackle this problem.

Third Assignment I feel like I was getting confused because I was dealing with multiple variables and I was all over the place
I didnt know what do with the variables given to me

The Fouth Assignment OH BOY
1. Whats the difference between Shape, Shape 2d, Shape 3d, and Shape 4d
2. I tried to search up what a constructer was but I did not understand it 
3. Whats the difference between a Constructer and a Method
4. What do you mean by Constucter with 3 points, 4 points etc
5. I did not fully understood abstract class definition
6. I did not understand what you are trying to say {must have field for # of dimensions}
